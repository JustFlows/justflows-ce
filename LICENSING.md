# Justflows Licensing

Justflows Community Edition uses a **permissive core with separately licensed extensions**:

- **Core:** MIT License
- **Plugins & themes** declare their own license (bundled examples use GPL-2.0-or-later). They are not MIT just because they ship next to core
- **Marketplace:** curated directory with security review (GPL-compatible extensions only)
- **Enterprise modules** (optional, separate): commercial license

**Version:** 4.0  
**Effective date:** 2026-08-20  
**Copyright holder:** Justflows Contributors

## Why MIT for core

1. **Easy to adopt** — host, embed, fork, and ship Justflows without copyleft on the platform itself
2. **Separate extension licenses** — plugins and themes keep the license their authors choose
3. **Contributions stay simple** — core contributions are MIT
4. **Proven model** — permissive core plus independently licensed extensions is common for modern platforms

- Each extension declares its own license in its manifest

- You charge for **download access**, **updates**, **support**, or **Marketplace convenience**
- Recipients of a GPL-licensed extension keep the rights of that GPL license

Enterprise-only features shipped **outside** the MIT core repository may use a
separate commercial license. They must not be required to run basic Community Edition.
